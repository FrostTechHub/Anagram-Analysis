# Anagram-Analysis

<h3>What is an Anagram?</h3>
<p>It is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters to form a new word or phrase. It typically uses all of the original letters exactly once!

I have written two algorithms to check whether the given strings are an anagram. As part of the test, I wondered how long it would
take for both algorithms to run if the number of characters in the given strings differed. So that you know, the results are in seconds.
Here is the result:</p>

<h4>ALGORITHM #1</h4>
- 3-Character Word:   0.0010128021240234375    seconds
- 10-Character Word:  0.009965181350708008     seconds
<br><br>
<h4>ALGORITHM #2</h4>
- 3-Character Word:   0.001001119613647461    seconds
- 10-Character Word:  0.001962900161743164    seconds
<br><br>
<p>If the given strings are three characters long, Algorithm #1 will run the fastest. However, if the strings are 10-characters long, 
Algorithm #2 would run the fastest. Why is that so? Stay Tune...</p>
