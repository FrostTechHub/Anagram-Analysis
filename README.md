# Anagram-Analysis

* What is an Anagram?
It is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters to form a new word or phrase. It typically uses all of the original letters exactly once!

I have wrote two algorithms to check if the given strings are indeed an anagram. As part of the test, I wondered how long it would
take for both algorithms run if the number of characters in the given strings were different. Do note that the results are in seconds.
Here is the result:

============================================================
ALGORITHM #1
============================================================
3-Character Word:   0.0010128021240234375    seconds
10-Character Word:  0.009965181350708008     seconds
============================================================
ALGORITHM #2
============================================================
3-Character Word:   0.001001119613647461    seconds
10-Character Word:  0.001962900161743164    seconds
============================================================

As you can see, if the given strings are 3-characters long, Algorithm #1 would run the fastest. However, if the strings are 10-characters long, 
Algorithm #2 would run the fastests. Why is that so? Stay Tune...
